# Web_accesibility_website
In this project, we are trying to help a marketing agency to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. 

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
To impress clients, i'm working on to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## My Project Goal
Make a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines

## Changing Details
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
WHEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
WHEN I find that the elements follow a logls
cd~cical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
WHEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
WHEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
WHEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
ect.

## What did i improve ?
1. Change all the div tags in index.html to semantic HTML elements (article,main,section,aside.)
2. Add id to "search-engine-optimization" box then make the button clickable
3. Add margin-bottom in style.css for the body elemant to add some space at the bottom of the web page.
4. Change the dispaly of the footer element to hide the footer from the vision.
