# Web_accesibility_website
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

## HTML
Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

## What did i improve ?
1. Change all the div tags in index.html to semantic HTML elements (article,main,section,aside,footer)
2. Add id to "search-engine-optimization" box then make the button clickable
3. Add margin-bottom in style.css for the body elemant to add some space at the bottom of the web page.
4. Change the dispaly of the footer element to hide the footer from the vision.
5. When i view the source code,I gavea webpage meets accessibility standards and I changed semantic HTML elements.
6. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements,I find that the elements follow a logics. And correct the structure independent of styling and positioning.
7. Change all image elements,accessible alt attributes,the heading attributes, title element,sequential order
Find a concise, descriptive title,
ect.

## My Project Goal
Make a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our site is optimized for search engines.I'm working on to improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
